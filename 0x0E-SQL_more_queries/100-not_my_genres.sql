-- Import the database dump from hbtn_0d_tvshows to your MySQL server:
-- +download (same as 16-shows_by_genre.sql)
-- ===========================================================================
-- Write a script that uses the hbtn_0d_tvshows database to list all genres
-- +not linked to the show Dexter
-- ===========================================================================
--  The tv_shows table contains only one record where title = Dexter
--  +(but the id can be different)
--  Each record should display: tv_genres.name
--  Results must be sorted in ascending order by the genre name
--  You can use a maximum of two SELECT statement
--  The database name will be passed as an argument of the mysql command
